# Claude Code Notes

## Claude Code’s creator just dropped a masterclass in how to get the most out of Claude Code:

1. Parallel worktrees - Run 3-5 git worktrees with separate Claude sessions. Biggest productivity unlock. Set up aliases (za, zb, zc) to hop between them.
2. Plan mode first - Pour energy into the plan, Claude 1-shots the implementation. When things go sideways, re-plan instead of pushing forward.
3. Invest in CLAUDE.md - After every correction: “Update your CLAUDE.md so you don’t make that mistake again.” Claude writes great rules for itself.
4. Create reusable skills - If you do it more than once a day, make it a skill or slash command. Commit to git, reuse across projects.
5. Let Claude fix bugs - Paste a Slack bug thread + say “fix.” Or just “Go fix the failing CI tests.” Don’t micromanage. It can troubleshoot docker logs too.
6. Challenge Claude - “Grill me on these changes, don’t make a PR until I pass.” After mediocre output: “Scrap this and implement the elegant solution.”
7. Environment setup - Team loves Ghostty terminal. Use /statusline for context usage. Voice dictation = 3x faster, more detailed prompts.
8. Subagents - Add “use subagents” when you want more compute on a problem. Keeps main context window clean.
9. Data & analytics - Ask Claude Code to use the “bq” CLI for BigQuery. Boris hasn’t written SQL in 6+ months. 
10. 10.Learning mode - Enable “Explanatory” output style in /config. Have Claude generate HTML presentations explaining unfamiliar code. Ask for ASCII diagrams of codebases.
